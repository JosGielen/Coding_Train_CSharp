# Coding_Train_CSharp
Coding Train challenges implemented in C#.net. 
See the Coding Train Challenges website : https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges

All my versions of these challenges were made as Windows Desktop Applications using the .Net C# language with WPF and Visual Studio 2019-2022 (Community Edition) with .NET version 4.7.2 or 8.0

To use the code in Visual Studio :
Create a new default C# Windows Desktop WPF Application with an appropriate name. (This should generate the project folder with a folder that contains the Mainwindow files)
Copy all the files to this folder (Overwrite Mainwindow.xaml and Mainwindow.xaml.cs).

Add reference to all the DLL files. (3D programs also need System.Drawing.dll)
Add all the .xaml and all the .cs files (other than Mainwindow) to the project. (Right click the project name , select Add..Existing Item if needed).
