# Coding_Train_CSharp
Coding Train challenges implemented in C#.net. All programs were made as Windows Desktop WPF Applications in Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition) with .NET version 4.7.2
.NET runtime 4.7.2 or higher is needed to run the applications.
To use the code in Visual Studio :
Create a new default Visual Basic Windows Desktop WPF Application with an appropriate name. (This should generate the Mainwindow files)
Copy all the files to this new project (Overwrite Mainwindow.xaml and Mainwindow.xaml.cs).
Add reference to all the DLL files. (3D programs also need System.Drawing.dll)
Add all the .xaml and all the .cs files (other than Mainwindow) to the project. (Right click the project name , select Add..Existing Item...)
