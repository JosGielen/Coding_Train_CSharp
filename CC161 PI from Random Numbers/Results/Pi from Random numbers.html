	<p><h1>PI Evolution from Random Numbers</h2></p>
	<p><h2>Theory</h2></p>
	<p>The value of PI can be estimated with the probability of two random integers being co-prime.<br/>
	The accuracy of this estimate increases as more random numbers are tested.<br/>
	<br/>
	This simulation was made in C# to show how the estimated value of PI converges towards the mathematical value of PI.<br/>
	It is based on the YouTube video made by Matt Parker: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU">Generating PI from 1,000 random numbers.</a></p>
	<p><h2>Results</h2></p>
	<p>Each time the program is run the random numbers are ofcourse different so the estimate follows a different path but after 2 million iterations the estimated value always converges to at least 3 decimal places.<p/>
