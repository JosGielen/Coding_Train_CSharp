	<p><h1>Worley Noise Examples</h1></p>
	<p>These examples of Worley Noise were made in C#. They are based on the examples shown in <br>
	<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z9d3tqVRyc">The Coding Train</a> live stream of 04/04/2020.</p>
	<p><h2>Basic Algorithm according to Wikipedia:</h2></p>
	<p>The basic idea is to take random points in space (2- or 3-dimensional) and then for every point in space<br>
	take the distance to the nth-closest point (e.g. the second-closest point) as some kind of color information.</p>
	<table>

			<td>When using the second closest point.</td>
			<td>With different points for R, G, B information</td>

					<p>During the life stream one of the viewers asked in the chat for making<br>
					a cell division example.This gave me the idea to try this:</p>
					<p>The Worley Noise seed points are now agents with simple physics engines<br>
					(position, velocity, acceleration and force).
					This was for example shown in <br>
					<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH&index=77&t=26s">Coding Challenge #59: Steering Behaviors.</a></p>
					<p>The seed points have 2 steering forces:<br>
					- Try to stay at a fixed distance to the closest 3 other seed points.<br>
					- A weak force pulling them to the middle of the image to prevent them <br>
					  wandering too far off.</p>
					<p>It is always fascinating to see the complex self-organising behaviour<br>
					that can result from such simple rules.</p>
